Decentralized Stable Coin (DSC)
Welcome to the Decentralized Stable Coin (DSC) repository! This project implements a decentralized stablecoin system that allows users to mint DSC tokens by depositing collateral. The system ensures that the value of the minted DSC is always backed by collateral, maintaining the stability of the stablecoin. The system also includes mechanisms for liquidation in case collateral value drops below a certain threshold.

Features
Collateral Management: Deposit and redeem collateral to back your DSC tokens.
Minting: Mint DSC tokens based on the value of your deposited collateral.
Burning: Burn DSC tokens to redeem collateral or reduce the total supply.
Liquidation: Automatically liquidate positions if collateral value falls below the liquidation threshold.
Health Factor Monitoring: Keep track of the health factor of collateralized positions to ensure system stability.
Functions Overview
Core Functions
Collateral Management

depositCollateral(address collateral, uint256 amount): Deposit a specified amount of collateral.
redeemedCollateral(address collateral, uint256 amount): Redeem a specified amount of collateral.
redeemedCollateralForDsc(address collateral, uint256 amountCollateral, uint256 amountDsc): Redeem collateral in exchange for burning DSC.
Minting and Burning DSC

mintDsc(uint256 amount): Mint a specified amount of DSC.
burnDsc(uint256 amount): Burn a specified amount of DSC to reduce the supply.
Collateral and Position Information

getAccountCollateralValue(address account): Get the total value of collateral deposited by an account.
getAccountInformation(address account): Get information about an account's collateral value and DSC minted.
getAmountDscMinted(): Get the total amount of DSC minted by the system.
getCollateralDeposited(address account, address collateral): Get the amount of a specific collateral token deposited by an account.
Liquidation and Health Factor
Liquidation

liquidate(address account, address collateral, uint256 amount): Liquidate a position by redeeming collateral and burning DSC.
Health Factor

calculateHealthFactor(uint256 collateralValue, uint256 dscMinted): Calculate the health factor of a position.
getHealthFactor(address account): Get the health factor of an account.
Price and Precision Management
Price Management

getPrecisionPrice(): Get the precision-adjusted price of collateral.
getAdditionalPrice(): Get an additional precision-adjusted price of collateral.
getCollateralTokenPriceFeed(address collateral): Get the price feed contract for a specific collateral token.
getTokenAmountFromUsd(address collateral, uint256 usdAmount): Convert a USD amount to the equivalent collateral token amount.
getUsdValue(address collateral, uint256 amount): Get the USD value of a specified amount of collateral.
Precision and Thresholds

PRECISION_PRICE(): The precision used for price calculations.
ADDITIONAL_PRECISION_PRICE(): Additional precision for price calculations.
LIQUIDATION_PRECISION(): Precision used for liquidation calculations.
LIQUIDATION_BONUS(): Bonus applied during liquidation.
LIQUIDATE_THRESHOLD(): Threshold at which liquidation is triggered.
LIMIT_HEALTH(): The limit at which a position is considered healthy.
System Variables
s_totalCollateralValueInUsd(): Total collateral value in the system, denominated in USD.
How It Works
The Decentralized Stable Coin (DSC) system allows users to deposit collateral, which is then used to mint DSC tokens. The value of DSC is pegged to the value of the deposited collateral. Users can redeem their collateral by burning DSC tokens. The system also features a liquidation mechanism that ensures positions are liquidated if the collateral value drops below a certain threshold, maintaining the stability of the DSC.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Solidity ^0.8.19
OpenZeppelin Contracts
Forge (for testing)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
forge install
Compile the contracts:

bash
Copy code
forge build
Running Tests
Run the tests to ensure the system functions correctly:

bash

forge test
Security Considerations
Ensure that the collateral value is correctly maintained to prevent under-collateralization.
Regularly update price feeds to prevent the use of stale data.
Monitor the health factor of positions to avoid unexpected liquidations.
